To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses. Methods We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data. Results A total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82%) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28% had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44% vs. 12%, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58% vs. 13%, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40% vs. 7%, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58%) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29%) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed. Conclusions Despite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1533-4406","ISOAbbreviation":"N.

Despite having been discovered in Uganda for almost 60 years, \u003c20 human cases were reported before 2007. The massive epidemics in the Pacific islands associated with the ZIKV Asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in Latin America in 2015. Although increased mosquito breeding associated with the El NiÃ±o effect superimposed on global warming is suspected, genetic changes in its RNA virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes, other animal reservoirs, and human. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention of this emerging infection. Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. Besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission, the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion, transplantation, sexual activity, breastfeeding, respiratory droplet, and animal bite is discussed. Epidemic control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds and personal protection against mosquito bite."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2016.

In May 2015, the virus was detected in Brazil and then spread through South and Central America. In December 2015, ZIKV was detected in French Guiana and Martinique. The aim of the study was to evaluate the vector competence of the mosquito spp. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe), North America (southern United States), South America (Brazil, French Guiana) for the currently circulating Asian genotype of ZIKV isolated from a patient in April 2014 in New Caledonia.","Mosquitoes were orally exposed to an Asian genotype of ZIKV (NC-2014-5132). Upon exposure, engorged mosquitoes were maintained at 28Â°Â±1Â°C, a 16h:8h light:dark cycle and 80% humidity. 25-30 mosquitoes were processed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), heads and saliva were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination and transmission, respectively. High infection but lower disseminated infection and transmission rates were observed for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.

We describe the current ZIKV infection epidemic in Brazil and the neurological symptoms arising. First cases of an acute exanthematic disease were reported in Brazil's Northeast region at the end of 2014. In March 2015, autochthonous ZIKV was determined to be the causative agent of the exanthematic disease. As cases of neurological syndromes in regions where ZIKV, dengue and/or Chikungunya viruses co-circulate were reported, ZIKV was also identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute neurological syndromes and previous exanthematic disease. By the end of September 2015, an increasing number of infants with small head circumference or microcephaly were noted in Brazil's Northeast which was estimated to be 29 cases between August and October. ZIKV was identified in blood and tissue samples of a newborn and in mothers who had given birth to infants with microcephaly and ophthalmological anomalies. In 2015, there were an estimated 440,000 - 1,300,000 Zika cases in Brazil. There have been 4,783 suspected cases of microcephaly, most of them in the Northeast of Brazil associated with 76 deaths. The Ministry of Health is intensifying control measures against the mosquito Aedes aegypti and implemented intensive surveillance actions. Further studies are needed to confirm the suspected association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly; to identify antiviral, immunotherapy, or prophylactic vaccine; to introduce diagnostic ELISA testing. Clinical and epidemiological studies must be performed to describe viral dynamics and expansion of the outbreak."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1972-2680","ISOAbbreviation":"J Infect Dev Ctries","Title":"Journal of infection in developing countries","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Year":"2016"},"Issue":"2","Volume":"10"}},"ELocationID":["10.3855/jidc.8217"],"ArticleTitle":"Zika virus outbreak in Brazil.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"02","Year":"2016","Day":"28"}],"Language":["eng"]},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"MedlineTA":"J Infect Dev Ctries","ISSNLinking":"1972-2680","NlmUniqueID":"101305410","Country":"Italy"},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"26927450","DateCreated":{"Month":"03","Year":"2016","Day":"01"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["26927450"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"2","Year":"2016","Day":"05"},{"Month":"2","Year":"2016","Day":"16"},{"Month":"2","Year":"2016","Day":"15"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"3","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"2"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"3","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"2"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"3","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"2"}]}}

The study was conducted between December 1 and December 21, 2015.","All infants and mothers underwent systemic and ophthalmic examinations from December 1 through December 21, 2015, in the Roberto Santos General Hospital, Salvador, Brazil. Anterior segment and retinal, choroidal, and optic nerve abnormalities were documented using a wide-field digital imaging system. The differential diagnosis included toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus, which were ruled out through serologic and clinical examinations.","Ocular abnormalities associated with ZIKV.","Twenty-three of 29 mothers (79.3%) reported suspected ZIKV infection signs and symptoms during pregnancy, 18 in the first trimester, 4 in the second trimester, and 1 in the third trimester. Of the 29 infants (58 eyes) examined (18 [62.1%] female), ocular abnormalities were present in 17 eyes (29.3%) of 10 children (34.5%). Bilateral findings were found in 7 of 10 patients presenting with ocular lesions, the most common of which were focal pigment mottling of the retina and chorioretinal atrophy in 11 of the 17 eyes with abnormalities (64.7%), followed by optic nerve abnormalities in 8 eyes (47.1%), bilateral iris coloboma in 1 patient (2 eyes [11.8%]), and lens subluxation in 1 eye (5.9%).","Congenital infection due to presumed ZIKV exposure is associated with vision-threatening findings, which include bilateral macular and perimacular lesions as well as optic nerve abnormalities in most cases."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2168-6173","ISOAbbreviation":"JAMA Ophthalmol","Title":"JAMA ophthalmology","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Month":"Feb","Year":"2016","Day":"9"}}},"ELocationID":["10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0267"],"ArticleTitle":"Ocular Findings in Infants With Microcephaly Associated With Presumed Zika Virus Congenital Infection in Salvador, Brazil.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"2","Year":"2016","Day":"9"}],"Language":["ENG"]},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"MedlineTA":"JAMA Ophthalmol","ISSNLinking":"2168-6165","NlmUniqueID":"101589539"},"CitationSubset":[],"PMID":"26865554","DateCreated":{"Month":"2","Year":"2016","Day":"11"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["2491896","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0267","26865554"],"PublicationStatus":"aheadofprint","History":[{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"12"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"13"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"13"}]}}

Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks of gestation revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain and placenta. After the mother requested termination of the pregnancy, a fetal autopsy was performed. Micrencephaly (an abnormally small brain) was observed, with almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with associated cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation. ZIKV was found in the fetal brain tissue on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with consistent findings on electron microscopy.

acute febrile illness (AFI) in Africa. With the advent of malaria rapid diagnostic tests, misdiagnosis and co-morbidity with other diseases has been highlighted by an increasing number of studies.

Malaria parasite infections were investigated using thick blood smear (TBS) and rapid diagnostics tests (RDT) while arbovirus infections were tested by IgM antibody detection (ELISA) and RT-PCR assays. Data analysis of single or concurrent malaria and arbovirus was performed using R software.","A total of 13,845 patients, including 7387 with malaria and 41 with acute arbovirus infections (12 YFV, nine ZIKV, 16 CHIKV, three DENV, and one RVFV) were enrolled.

Dengue fever has been a serious public health problem in Brazil for decades, with recurrent epidemic outbreaks occurring during summers. In 2015, until November, 1,534,932 possible cases were reported to the Ministry of Healthv [1]. More recently, the less studied CHIKV and ZIKV have gained attention because of a dramatic increase in their incidence (around 400% for CHIKV) and the association of ZIKV infection with a 11-fold increase in the number of cases of microcephaly from 2014 to 2015 in northeast Brazil (1761 cases until December 2015) [1]. The symptoms of these three infections are very similar, which complicates the diagnosis. These include fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, and joint pain. In some cases, DENV infection develops into dengue hemorrhagic fever, a life threatening condition characterized by bleeding and decreases in platelet numbers in the blood. As for CHIKV, the most important complication is joint pain, which can last for months."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2016 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

In 2013, a large outbreak was reported on the archipelago of French Polynesia. In this study, we report the detection and molecular characterization of Zika virus for the first time in Chile from an outbreak among the inhabitants of Easter Island. A total of 89 samples from patients suspected of having ZIKV infection were collected between the period from January to May, 2014. Molecular diagnosis of the virus was performed by RT-PCR followed by the sequencing of the region containing the NS5 gene. A comparison of the viral nucleic acid sequence with those of other strains of ZIKA virus was performed using the MEGA software. Fifty-one samples were found positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR analysis. Further analysis of the NS5 gene revealed that the ZIKV strains identified in Easter Island were most closely related to those found in French Polynesia (99.8 to 99.9Â % nt and 100Â % aa sequence identity). These results strongly suggest that the transmission pathway leading to the introduction of Zika virus on Easter Island has its origin in French Polynesia."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1432-8798","ISOAbbreviation":"Arch.

in a zoonotic cycle between arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes and nonhuman primates in African and Asian forests. Serological evidence and virus isolations have demonstrated widespread distribution of the virus in Senegal. Several mosquito species have been found naturally infected by ZIKV but little is known about their vector competence.","We assessed the vector competence of Ae. aegypti from Kedougou and Dakar, Ae. unilineatus, Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus from Kedougou in Senegal for 6 ZIKV strains using experimental oral infection. Fully engorged female mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 27âÂ±â1 Â°C and 80âÂ±â5% Relative humidity. At day 5, 10 and 15 days post infection (dpi), individual mosquito saliva, legs/wings and bodies were tested for the presence of ZIKV genome using real time RT-PCR to estimate the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates.","All the species tested were infected by all viral strains but only Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus were potentially capable of transmitting ZIKV after 15 dpi with 20 and 50% of mosquitoes, respectively, delivering epidemic (HD 78788) and prototype (MR 766) ZIKV strains in saliva.","All the species tested here were susceptible to oral infection of ZIKV but only a low proportion of Ae. vittatus and Ae. luteocephalus had the viral genome in their saliva and thus the potential to transmit the virus. Further investigations are needed on the vector competence of other species associated with ZIKV for better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of this virus in Senegal."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2334","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Infect.

The potential for ZIKV transmission through blood transfusion was demonstrated during the ZIKV outbreak that occurred in French Polynesia from October 2013 to April 2014. Pathogen inactivation of blood products is a proactive strategy that provides the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases. Inactivation of arboviruses by amotosalen and ultraviolet A (UVA) illumination was previously demonstrated for chikungunya, West Nile, and dengue viruses. We report here the efficiency of this process for ZIKV inactivation of human plasma.","Plasma units were spiked with ZIKV. Viral titers and RNA loads were measured in plasma before and after amotosalen and UVA photochemical treatment.","The mean ZIKV titers and RNA loads in plasma before inactivation were respectively 6.57 log TCID50 /mL and 10.25 log copies/mL. After inactivation, the mean ZIKV RNA loads was 9.51 log copies/mL, but cell cultures inoculated with inactivated plasma did not result in infected cells and did not produce any replicative virus after one passage, nor detectable viral RNA from the second passage.","In this study we demonstrate that amotosalen combined with UVA light inactivates ZIKV in fresh-frozen plasma. This inactivation process is of particular interest to prevent plasma transfusion-transmitted ZIKV infections in areas such as French Polynesia, where several arboviruses are cocirculating."],"CopyrightInformation":"Â© 2015 The Authors Transfusion published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of AABB."},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1537-2995","ISOAbbreviation":"Transfusion","Title":"Transfusion","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Month":"Jan","Year":"2016"},"Issue":"1","Volume":"56"}},"ELocationID":["10.1111/trf.13271"],"ArticleTitle":"Inactivation of Zika virus in plasma with amotosalen and ultraviolet A illumination.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"08","Year":"2015","Day":"18"}],"Language":["eng"]},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"MedlineTA":"Transfusion","ISSNLinking":"0041-1132","NlmUniqueID":"0417360","Country":"United States"},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"26283013","DateCreated":{"Month":"01","Year":"2016","Day":"13"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1111/trf.13271","26283013"],"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":[{"Month":"3","Year":"2015","Day":"30"},{"Month":"6","Year":"2015","Day":"26"},{"Month":"7","Year":"2015","Day":"8"},{"Month":"8","Year":"2015","Day":"18"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"8","Minute":"0","Year":"2015","Day":"19"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"8","Minute":"0","Year":"2015","Day":"19"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"8","Minute":"0","Year":"2015","Day":"19"}]}}

yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, that causes a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by the Aedes genus, with recent outbreaks in the South Pacific. Here we examine the importance of human skin in the entry of ZIKV and its contribution to the induction of antiviral immune responses. We show that human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells are permissive to the most recent ZIKV isolate, responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia. Several entry and/or adhesion factors, including DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3, and, to a lesser extent, TIM-1, permitted ZIKV entry, with a major role for the TAM receptor AXL. The ZIKV permissiveness of human skin fibroblasts was confirmed by the use of a neutralizing antibody and specific RNA silencing. ZIKV induced the transcription of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, and MDA5, as well as several interferon-stimulated genes, including OAS2, ISG15, and MX1, characterized by strongly enhanced beta interferon gene expression. ZIKV was found to be sensitive to the antiviral effects of both type I and type II interferons. Finally, infection of skin fibroblasts resulted in the formation of autophagosomes, whose presence was associated with enhanced viral replication, as shown by the use of Torin 1, a chemical inducer of autophagy, and the specific autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. The results presented herein permit us to gain further insight into the biology of ZIKV and to devise strategies aiming to interfere with the pathology caused by this emerging flavivirus.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Vector-mediated transmission of ZIKV is initiated when a blood-feeding female Aedes mosquito injects the virus into the skin of its mammalian host, followed by infection of permissive cells via specific receptors. Indeed, skin immune cells, including dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, were all found to be permissive to ZIKV infection. The results also show a major role for the phosphatidylserine receptor AXL as a ZIKV entry receptor and for cellular autophagy in enhancing ZIKV replication in permissive cells. ZIKV replication leads to activation of an antiviral innate immune response and the production of type I interferons in infected cells. Taken together, these results provide the first general insights into the interaction between ZIKV and its mammalian host."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Both patients presented with low grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, myalgia, arthralgia, ankle oedema, and axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. One patient showed leukopenia with relative monocytosis and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis was based on ZIKV seroconversion in both cases and on ZIKV RNA detection in one patient from acute serum sample. Sera from both patients exhibited cross-reactivity with dengue virus antigens. Our immunological analysis demonstrated that recovery from ZIKV infection is associated with restoration of normal numbers of immune cells in the periphery as well as with normal function of antigen-presenting cells. ZIKV is an emerging arbovirus, which has recently spread extensively in tourist destinations on several West Pacific islands. Returning viremic travelers may ignite autochthonous infections in countries like Italy, which are infested by Aedes albopictus, a suitable vector for ZIKV. The role of clinicians is crucial and includes early diagnosis and timely notification of public health authorities in order to quickly implement adequate focal vector control measurements."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The three viruses were isolated from two species of mosquito, Aedes africanus and Ae. opok. Two sequences from Ae. africanus had 99.9% nucleotide sequence identity and 100% amino acid identity, whereas the complete genome obtained from Ae. opok had 98.3% nucleotide identity and 99.4% amino acid identity with the other two genomes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the polyprotein showed that the three ZIKV strains clustered together but diverged from all other ZIKV strains.

zoonotic cycle between arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes and nonhuman primates in African and Asian forests. Spillover into humans has been documented in both regions and the virus is currently responsible for a large outbreak in French Polynesia. ZIKV amplifications are frequent in southeastern Senegal but little is known about their seasonal and spatial dynamics. The aim of this paper is to describe the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2011 ZIKV amplification in southeastern Senegal.","Mosquitoes were collected monthly from April to December 2011 except during July. Each evening from 18:00 to 21:00 hrs landing collections were performed by teams of 3 persons working simultaneously in forest (canopy and ground), savannah, agriculture, village (indoor and outdoor) and barren land cover sites. Mosquitoes were tested for virus infection by virus isolation and RT-PCR. ZIKV was detected in 31 of the 1,700 mosquito pools (11,247 mosquitoes) tested: Ae. furcifer (5), Ae. luteocephalus (5), Ae. africanus (5), Ae. vittatus (3), Ae. taylori, Ae. dalzieli, Ae. hirsutus and Ae. metallicus (2 each) and Ae. aegypti, Ae. unilinaetus, Ma. uniformis, Cx. perfuscus and An. coustani (1 pool each) collected in June (3), September (10), October (11), November (6) and December (1). ZIKV was detected from mosquitoes collected in all land cover classes except indoor locations within villages. The virus was detected in only one of the ten villages investigated.","This ZIKV amplification was widespread in the KÃ©dougou area, involved several mosquito species as probable vectors, and encompassed all investigated land cover classes except indoor locations within villages. Aedes furcifer males and Aedes vittatus were found infected within a village, thus these species are probably involved in the transmission of Zika virus to humans in this environment."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE","Title":"PloS one","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Year":"2014"},"Issue":"10","Volume":"9"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pone.0109442"],"ArticleTitle":"Zika virus emergence in mosquitoes in southeastern Senegal, 2011.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"13"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"25310102","DateCreated":{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"14"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pone.0109442","PONE-D-14-14811","25310102","PMC4195678"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"","Year":"2014","Day":""},{"Month":"4","Year":"2014","Day":"11"},{"Month":"9","Year":"2014","Day":"4"},{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"13"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"10","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"14"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"10","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"14"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"6","Minute":"0","Year":"2015","Day":"30"}]}}

prompted entomological studies to identify both the primary vector(s) involved in transmission and the ecological parameters contributing to the outbreak. Larval and pupal surveys were performed to identify the major containers serving as oviposition habitat for the likely vector(s). Adult mosquitoes were also collected by backpack aspiration, light trap, and gravid traps at select sites around the capital city. The predominant species found on the island was Aedes (Stegomyia) hensilli. No virus isolates were obtained from the adult field material collected, nor did any of the immature mosquitoes that were allowed to emerge to adulthood contain viable virus or nucleic acid. Therefore, laboratory studies of the probable vector, Ae. hensilli, were undertaken to determine the likelihood of this species serving as a vector for Zika virus and other arboviruses. Infection rates of up to 86%, 62%, and 20% and dissemination rates of 23%, 80%, and 17% for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue-2 viruses respectively, were found supporting the possibility that this species served as a vector during the Zika outbreak and that it could play a role in transmitting other medically important arboviruses."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1935-2735","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Title":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Month":"Oct","Year":"2014"},"Issue":"10","Volume":"8"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0003188"],"ArticleTitle":"Aedes hensilli as a potential vector of Chikungunya and Zika viruses.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"09"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"25299181","DateCreated":{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"10"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0003188","PNTD-D-14-00597","25299181","PMC4191940"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":""},{"Month":"4","Year":"2014","Day":"9"},{"Month":"8","Year":"2014","Day":"14"},{"Month":"10","Year":"2014","Day":"9"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"10","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"10"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"10","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"10"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2016","Day":"9"}]}}

Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV activity had been reported in Africa and in Asia through virological surveillance and entomological studies. French Polynesia has recorded a large outbreak since October 2013. A great number of cases and some with neurological and autoimmune complications have been reported in a context of concurrent circulation of dengue viruses. The clinical presentation is a \"dengue-like syndrome\". Until the epidemic in French Polynesia, no severe ZIKV disease had been described so far. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral genome detection by genomic amplification (RT- PCR) and viral isolation. These two large outbreaks occurred in a previously unaffected area in less than a decade. They should raise awareness as to the potential for ZIKV to spread especially since this emergent disease is not well known and that some questions remain on potential reservoirs and transmission modes as well as on clinical presentations and complications. ZIKV has the potential to spread to new areas where the Aedes mosquito vector is present and could be a risk for Southern Europe.

Both viruses subsequently spread to the south-east of the country, with new outbreaks occurring in 2010. The mosquito species Aedes albopictus, that was known as a secondary vector for both viruses, recently invaded the country and was the primary vector involved in the Gabonese outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective study of human sera and mosquitoes collected in Gabon from 2007 to 2010, in order to identify other circulating arboviruses.","Sample collections, including 4312 sera from patients presenting with painful febrile disease, and 4665 mosquitoes belonging to 9 species, split into 247 pools (including 137 pools of Aedes albopictus), were screened with molecular biology methods. Five human sera and two Aedes albopictus pools, all sampled in an urban setting during the 2007 outbreak, were positive for the flavivirus Zika (ZIKV). The ratio of Aedes albopictus pools positive for ZIKV was similar to that positive for dengue virus during the concomitant dengue outbreak suggesting similar mosquito infection rates and, presumably, underlying a human ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV sequences from the envelope and NS3 genes were amplified from a human serum sample. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Gabonese ZIKV at a basal position in the African lineage, pointing to ancestral genetic diversification and spread.","We provide the first direct evidence of human ZIKV infections in Gabon, and its first occurrence in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. These data reveal an unusual natural life cycle for this virus, occurring in an urban environment, and potentially representing a new emerging threat due to this novel association with a highly invasive vector whose geographic range is still expanding across the globe."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1935-2735","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Title":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Month":"Feb","Year":"2014"},"Issue":"2","Volume":"8"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002681"],"ArticleTitle":"Zika virus in Gabon (Central Africa)--2007: a new threat from Aedes albopictus?","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"02","Year":"2014","Day":"06"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"24516683","DateCreated":{"Month":"02","Year":"2014","Day":"11"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002681","PNTD-D-13-01157","24516683","PMC3916288"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"2","Year":"2014","Day":""},{"Month":"6","Year":"2013","Day":"27"},{"Month":"12","Year":"2013","Day":"19"},{"Month":"2","Year":"2014","Day":"6"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"12"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"12"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"11","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"5"}]}}

Although entomological and virologic surveillance have reported ZIKV enzootic activity in diverse countries of Africa and Asia, few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika fever epidemic took place in Micronesia. In the context of West Africa, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arboviruses and Hemorrhagic Fever at Institut Pasteur of Dakar (http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/banques/CRORA/) reports the periodic circulation of ZIKV since 1968. Despite several reports on ZIKV, the genetic relationships among viral strains from West Africa remain poorly understood. To evaluate the viral spread and its molecular epidemiology, we investigated 37 ZIKV isolates collected from 1968 to 2002 in six localities in Senegal and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. In addition, we included strains from six other countries. Our results suggested that these two countries in West Africa experienced at least two independent introductions of ZIKV during the 20(th) century, and that apparently these viral lineages were not restricted by mosquito vector species. Moreover, we present evidence that ZIKV has possibly undergone recombination in nature and that a loss of the N154 glycosylation site in the envelope protein was a possible adaptive response to the Aedes dalzieli vector."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1935-2735","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Title":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Year":"2014"},"Issue":"1","Volume":"8"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002636"],"ArticleTitle":"Molecular evolution of Zika virus during its emergence in the 20(th) century.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"01","Year":"2014","Day":"09"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"24421913","DateCreated":{"Month":"01","Year":"2014","Day":"14"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002636","PNTD-D-13-00377","24421913","PMC3888466"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"1","Year":"2014","Day":""},{"Month":"3","Year":"2013","Day":"4"},{"Month":"11","Year":"2013","Day":"27"},{"Month":"1","Year":"2014","Day":"9"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"1","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"15"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"1","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"15"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"9","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"10"}]}}

ZIKV infection diagnosis relies on serology-which is challenging due to cross-reactions with other flaviviruses and/or absence or low titer of IgM and IgG antibodies at early phase of infection- virus isolation, which is labor intensive, time consuming and requires appropriate containment. Therefore, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) is an appealing option as a rapid, sensitive and specific method for detection of ZIKV in the early stage of infection. So far, only one rRT-PCR assay has been described in the context of the outbreak in Micronesia in 2007. In this study, we described a one step rRT-PCR for ZIKV which can detect a wider genetic diversity of ZIKV isolates from Asia and Africa.","The NS5 protein coding regions of African ZIKV isolates were sequenced and aligned with representative flaviviruses sequences from GenBank to design primers and probe from conserved regions. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was evaluated to be 32 genome-equivalents and 0.05 plaque forming unit (pfu). The assay was shown to detect 37 ZIKV isolates covering a wide geographic in Africa and Asia over 36 years but none of the 31 other flaviviruses tested showing high analytical specificity. The rRT-PCR could be performed in less than 3 hours. This method was used successfully to detect ZIKV strains from field-caught mosquitoes.","We have developed a rapid, sensitive and specific rRT-PCR for detection of ZIKV. This assay is a useful tool for detection of ZIKV infection in regions where a number of other clinically indistinguishable arboviruses like dengue or chikungunya co-circulate. Further studies are needed to validate this assay in clinical positive samples collected during acute ZIKV infection."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1743-422X","ISOAbbreviation":"Virol.

Although the virus has a wide geographic distribution, most of the known vectors are sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes from Africa where the virus was first isolated. Presently, Ae. aegypti is the only known vector to transmit the virus outside the African continent, though Ae. albopictus has long been a suspected vector. Currently, Ae. albopictus has been shown capable of transmitting more than 20 arboviruses and its notoriety as an important vector came to light during the recent chikungunya pandemic. The vulnerability of Singapore to emerging infectious arboviruses has stimulated our interest to determine the competence of local Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV.","To determine the competence of Ae. albopictus to ZIKV, we orally infected local mosquito strains to a Ugandan strain virus. Fully engorged mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 29Â°C and 80-85%RH. Twelve mosquitoes were then sampled daily from day one to seven and on day 10 and 14 post infection (pi). Zika virus titre in the midgut and salivary glands of each mosquito were determined using tissue culture infectious dose50 assay, while transmissibility of the virus was determined by detecting viral antigen in the mosquito saliva by qRT-PCR. High dissemination and transmission rate of ZIKV were observed. By day 7-pi, all mosquitoes have disseminated infection and 73% of these mosquitoes have ZIKV in their saliva. By day 10-pi, all mosquitoes were potentially infectious.","The study highlighted the potential of Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV and the possibility that the virus could be established locally. Nonetheless, the threat of ZIKV can be mitigated by existing dengue and chikungunya control program being implemented in Singapore."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1935-2735","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Title":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Year":"2013"},"Issue":"8","Volume":"7"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002348"],"ArticleTitle":"Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse): a potential vector of Zika virus in Singapore.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"08","Year":"2013","Day":"01"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"23936579","DateCreated":{"Month":"08","Year":"2013","Day":"12"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0002348","PNTD-D-13-00504","23936579","PMC3731215"],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","History":[{"Month":"8","Year":"2013","Day":""},{"Month":"4","Year":"2013","Day":"10"},{"Month":"6","Year":"2013","Day":"18"},{"Month":"8","Year":"2013","Day":"1"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"8","Minute":"0","Year":"2013","Day":"13"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"8","Minute":"0","Year":"2013","Day":"13"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"3","Minute":"0","Year":"2014","Day":"1"}]}}

Pacific Island of Yap. It causes dengue-like syndromes but with milder symptoms. In Africa, where it was first isolated, ZIKV is mainly transmitted by sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes. The virus has also been isolated from Ae. aegypti and it is considered to be the vector involved in the urban transmission of the virus. Transmission of the virus by an African strain of Ae. aegypti has also been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. The aim of the present study is to describe the oral susceptibility of a Singapore strain of Ae. aegypti to ZIKV, under conditions that simulate local climate.","To assess the receptivity of Singapore's Ae. aegypti to the virus, we orally exposed a local mosquito strain to a Ugandan strain of ZIKV. Upon exposure, fully engorged mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 29 Â°C and 70-75% RH. Eight mosquitoes were then sampled daily from day 1 to day 7, and subsequently on days 10 and 14 post exposure (pe). The virus titer of the midgut and salivary glands of each mosquito were determined using a tissue culture infectious dose(50) (TCID(50)) assay. High midgut infection and salivary gland dissemination rates were observed. By day 5 after the infectious blood meal, ZIKV was found in the salivary glands of more than half of the mosquitoes tested (62%); and by day 10, all mosquitoes were potentially infective.","This study showed that Singapore's urban Ae. aegypti are susceptible and are potentially capable of transmitting ZIKV. The virus could be established in Singapore should it be introduced. Nevertheless, Singapore's current dengue control strategy is applicable to control ZIKV."]},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1935-2735","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","Title":"PLoS neglected tropical diseases","JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Year":"2012"},"Issue":"8","Volume":"6"}},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0001792"],"ArticleTitle":"Oral susceptibility of Singapore Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus) to Zika virus.","ArticleDate":[{"Month":"08","Year":"2012","Day":"28"}],"Language":["eng"]},"CitationSubset":["IM"],"PMID":"22953014","DateCreated":{"Month":"09","Year":"2012","Day":"06"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pntd.0001792","PNTD-D-12-00044","22953014","PMC3429392"],"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":[{"Month":"1","Year":"2012","Day":"9"},{"Month":"7","Year":"2012","Day":"11"},{"Month":"8","Year":"2012","Day":"28"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"9","Minute":"0","Year":"2012","Day":"7"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"9","Minute":"0","Year":"2012","Day":"7"},{"Hour":"6","Month":"1","Minute":"0","Year":"2013","Day":"4"}]}}

Infection results in a dengue-like illness with fever, headache, malaise, and a maculopapular rash. Nearly all cases are mild and self-limiting but in 2007, a large outbreak of ZIKV was reported from the island of Yap (in Micronesia, northwest of Indonesia). Singapore is already endemic for dengue, and its impact on public health and economic burden is significant. Other dengue-like infections (e.g., Chikungunya virus) are present. Yet only 10% of reported dengue cases have laboratory confirmation. The identification and control of other dengue-like, mosquito-transmitted infections is thus important for the health of Singapore's population, as well as its economy. Given that ZIKV shares the same Aedes mosquito vector with both dengue and Chikungunya, it is possible that this virus is present in Singapore and causing some of the mild dengue-like illness. A specific and sensitive one-step, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with an internal control (IC) was designed and tested on 88 archived samples of dengue-negative, Chikungunya-negative sera from patients presenting to our hospital with a dengue-like illness, to determine the presence of ZIKV in Singapore. The assay was specific for detection of ZIKV and displayed a lower limit of detection (LoD) of 140 copies viral RNA/reaction when tested on synthetic RNA standards prepared using pooled negative patient plasma. Of the 88 samples tested, none were positive for ZIKV RNA, however, the vast majority of these were from patients admitted to hospital and further study may be warranted in community-based environments."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1096-9071","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

flavivirus distributed throughout much of Africa and Asia. Infection with the virus may cause acute febrile illness that clinically resembles dengue fever. A recent study indicated the existence of three geographically distinct viral lineages; however this analysis utilized only a single viral gene. Although ZIKV has been known to circulate in both Africa and Asia since at least the 1950s, little is known about the genetic relationships between geographically distinct virus strains. Moreover, the geographic origin of the strains responsible for the epidemic that occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, and a 2010 pediatric case in Cambodia, has not been determined.","To elucidate the genetic relationships of geographically distinct ZIKV strains and the origin of the strains responsible for the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island and a 2010 Cambodian pediatric case of ZIKV infection, the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame of five isolates from Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal collected between 1947 and 2010 were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these and previously published ZIKV sequences revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African and Asian) and that the strain responsible for the Yap epidemic and the Cambodian case most likely originated in Southeast Asia. Examination of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments revealed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in some of the virus strains, which may correlate with the passage history of the virus.","The basal position of the ZIKV strain isolated in Malaysia in 1966 suggests that the recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain from Southeast Asia.

During the same period, an increase in Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome was reported, suggesting a possible association between Zika virus and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.","In this case-control study, cases were patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier de PolynÃ©sie FranÃ§aise (Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia) during the outbreak period. Controls were age-matched, sex-matched, and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (control group 1; n=98) and age-matched patients with acute Zika virus disease and no neurological symptoms (control group 2; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for Zika virus, and both microsphere immunofluorescent and seroneutralisation assays for Zika virus and dengue virus. Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome using both ELISA and combinatorial microarrays.","42 patients were diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome during the study period. 41 (98%) patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome had anti-Zika virus IgM or IgG, and all (100%) had neutralising antibodies against Zika virus compared with 54 (56%) of 98 in control group 1 (p\u003c0Â·0001). 39 (93%) patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome had Zika virus IgM and 37 (88%) had experienced a transient illness in a median of 6 days (IQR 4-10) before the onset of neurological symptoms, suggesting recent Zika virus infection. Patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome had electrophysiological findings compatible with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) type, and had rapid evolution of disease (median duration of the installation and plateau phases was 6 [IQR 4-9] and 4 days [3-10], respectively). 12 (29%) patients required respiratory assistance. No patients died. Anti-glycolipid antibody activity was found in 13 (31%) patients, and notably against GA1 in eight (19%) patients, by ELISA and 19 (46%) of 41 by glycoarray at admission. The typical AMAN-associated anti-ganglioside antibodies were rarely present. Past dengue virus history did not differ significantly between patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and those in the two control groups (95%, 89%, and 83%, respectively).","This is the first study providing evidence for Zika virus infection causing Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Because Zika virus is spreading rapidly across the Americas, at risk countries need to prepare for adequate intensive care beds capacity to manage patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.","Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases, EU 7th framework program PREDEMICS. and Wellcome Trust."]},"ELocationID":["S0140-6736(16)00562-6","10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"29","Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Lancet (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Lancet","ISSN":"1474-547X"},"ArticleTitle":"Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome outbreak associated with Zika virus infection in French Polynesia: a case-control study.","Language":["ENG"],"PublicationTypeList":["JOURNAL ARTICLE"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":""},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"29","Year":"2016","Month":"2"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Unit of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Institut Louis MalardÃ©, Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Cao-Lormeau","Initials":"VM","ForeName":"Van-Mai"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Institut Pasteur, Emerging Diseases Epidemiology Unit, Paris, France."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Blake","Initials":"A","ForeName":"Alexandre"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Service de RÃ©animation Polyvalente, Centre Hospitalier de PolynÃ©sie FranÃ§aise, Tahiti, French Polynesia."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Mons","Initials":"S","ForeName":"Sandrine"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Clinical Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de PolynÃ©sie FranÃ§aise, Tahiti, French Polynesia."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"LastÃ¨re","Initials":"S","ForeName":"StÃ©phane"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Unit of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Institut Louis MalardÃ©, Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Roche","Initials":"C","ForeName":"Claudine"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Institut Pasteur, Laboratory for Urgent Responses to Biological Threats, Paris, France;

Data on dengue infection rates are not readily available in most places where the disease is known to occur.","A newly available add-in to Esri's ArcGIS software package, the ArcGIS Predictive Analysis Toolset (PA Tools), was used to identify locations within Africa with environmental characteristics likely to be suitable for transmission of dengue virus.","A more accurate, robust, and localized (1km x 1km) dengue risk map for Africa was created based on bioclimatic layers, elevation data, high-resolution population data, and other environmental factors that a search of the peer-reviewed literature showed to be associated with dengue risk. Variables related to temperature, precipitation, elevation, and population density were identified as good predictors of dengue suitability. Areas of high dengue suitability occur primarily within West Africa and parts of Central Africa and East Africa, but even in these regions the suitability is not homogenous.","This risk mapping technique for an infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes draws on entomological, epidemiological, and geographic data. The method could be applied to other infectious diseases (such as Zika) in order to provide new insights for public health officials and others making decisions about where to increase disease surveillance activities and implement infection prevention and control efforts. The ability to map threats to human and animal health is important for tracking vectorborne and other emerging infectious diseases and modeling the likely impacts of climate change."]},"ELocationID":["S0001-706X(16)30080-8","10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.02.018"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"2","Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Acta tropica","ISOAbbreviation":"Acta Trop.","ISSN":"1873-6254"},"ArticleTitle":"Risk analysis for dengue suitability in Africa using the ArcGIS Predictive Analysis Tools (PA Tools).","Language":["ENG"],"PublicationTypeList":["JOURNAL ARTICLE"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":""},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"2","Year":"2016","Month":"3"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Department of Geography and GeoInformation Science, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MS 6C3, Fairfax, VA 22030-4444, USA; Esri, 8615 Westwood Center Drive, Vienna, VA 22182, USA.

While mother-to-fetus transmission, fetal neurologic manifestations or sexual transmission have never been documented for this virus before, other viruses that belong to the same family are very well known to reproductive health workers, clinicians, and researchers. As a member of Flaviviridae family, including hepatitis C and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Zika's pathogenesis may have some parallels with these infections which may pose future questions for public health and research. Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus from mother to child is known to occur in up to 10Â % of pregnancies. BVDV, a member of Pestivirus genus of Flaviviridae family is not known to be transmitted to humans but is known for its vertical transmission in cattle. BVDV infection at different stages of gestation may lead to a spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss and neurologic manifestations (including deformations such as hydrocephalus and microcephaly) in the offspring. Similar to hepatitis C, which is a virus of Hepacivirus genus, BVDV is capable of persistent infection, meaning that virus may stay in mother and future generations of calves may be infected as well, which may, in turn, result in persistence of infection in offspring. Would this be a case with Zika virus? Along with mother-to-fetus transmission, sexual transmission is a concerning implication for Zika virus. Would woman become a persistent career or male be able to persistently carry virus with its sperm is yet unknown; yet, there is a concern for the reservoir of infection. Animal models of the disease are urgently needed not only to demonstrate the mother-to-fetus transmission and confirm the fetal neurologic manifestations but also to address the effects of virus on life-long host's immunity and reproductive health. Along those lines, women desiring pregnancies who are identified to travel, have a partner traveling to, or living in the areas of Zika infections should be encouraged to have a preconception consultation with maternal-fetal medicine."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"4","Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

Its importance increased in the Americas over the past 20 years. The main vectors are Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. Dengue infection provides long lasting immunity against the specific serotype and temporary to the other three. Subsequent infection by another serotype determines more serious disease. There is a registered vaccine for dengue, Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur). Other two (Butantan and Takeda) are in Phase III in 2016. Zika infection is usually asymptomatic or occurs with rash, conjunctivitis and not very high fever. There is no vaccine or specific treatment. It can be transmitted by parental, sexual and via blood transfusion. It has been associated with microcephaly. Chikungunya causes prolonged joint pain and persistent immune response. Two candidate vaccines are in Phase II. Dengue direct diagnosis is performed by virus isolation, RT-PCR and ELISA for NS1 antigen detection; indirect methods are ELISA-IgM (cross-reacting with other flavivirus), MAC-ELISA, and plaque neutralization. Zika is diagnosed by RT-PCR and virus isolation. Serological diagnosis cross-reacts with other flavivirus. For CHIKV culture, RT-PCR, MAC-ELISA and plaque neutralization are used. Against Aedes organophosphate larvicides (temephos), organophosphorus insecticides (malathion and fenitrothion) and pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) are usually employed.

On January 19, CDC released interim guidelines for U.S. health care providers caring for pregnant women with travel to an affected area (1), and an update was released on February 5 (2). As of February 17, CDC had received reports of nine pregnant travelers with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus disease; 10 additional reports of Zika virus disease among pregnant women are currently under investigation. No Zika virus-related hospitalizations or deaths among pregnant women were reported. Pregnancy outcomes among the nine confirmed cases included two early pregnancy losses, two elective terminations, and three live births (two apparently healthy infants and one infant with severe microcephaly); two pregnancies (approximately 18 weeks' and 34 weeks' gestation) are continuing without known complications. Confirmed cases of Zika virus infection were reported among women who had traveled to one or more of the following nine areas with ongoing local transmission of Zika virus: American Samoa, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Samoa. This report summarizes findings from the nine women with confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy, including case reports for four women with various clinical outcomes. U.S. health care providers caring for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure during pregnancy should follow CDC guidelines for patient evaluation and management (1,2). Zika virus disease is a nationally notifiable condition. CDC has developed a voluntary registry to collect information about U.S. pregnant women with confirmed Zika virus infection and their infants.

There are no licensed medical countermeasures (vaccines, therapies or preventive drugs) available for Zika virus infection and disease. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) predicts that Zika virus will continue to spread and eventually reach all countries and territories in the Americas with endemic Aedes mosquitoes. This paper reviews the status of the Zika virus outbreak, including medical countermeasure options, with a focus on how the epidemiology, insect vectors, neuropathology, virology and immunology inform options and strategies available for medical countermeasure development and deployment.","Multiple information sources were employed to support the review. These included publically available literature, patents, official communications, English and Lusophone lay press. Online surveys were distributed to physicians in the US, Mexico and Argentina and responses analyzed. Computational epitope analysis as well as infectious disease outbreak modeling and forecasting were implemented.

To our mind, 2015 was an extraordinary year for malaria control, due to three hot news: the Nobel Prize to Youyou Tu for the discovery of artemisinin, the development of the first vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [i.e. RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S)], and the fall of malaria infection rates worldwide, with special reference to sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are major challenges that still deserve attention, in order to boost malaria prevention and control. Indeed, parasite strains resistant to artemisinin have been detected, and RTS,S vaccine does not offer protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa. Furthermore, the recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections, occurring in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, represent the most recent of four arrivals of important arboviruses in the Western Hemisphere, over the last 20Â years. Zika virus follows dengue (which slyly arrived in the hemisphere over decades and became more aggressive in the 1990s), West Nile virus (emerged in 1999) and chikungunya (emerged in 2013). Notably, there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses. The emerging scenario highlights that the effective and eco-friendly control of mosquito vectors, with special reference to highly invasive species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is crucial. The concrete potential of screening plant species as sources of metabolites for parasitological purposes is worthy of attention, as elucidated by the Y. Tu's example. Notably, plant-borne molecules are often effective at few parts per million against Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Culex young instars, can be used for the rapid synthesis of mosquitocidal nanoformulations and even employed to prepare cheap repellents with low human toxicity. In addition, behaviour-based control tools relying to the employ of sound traps and the manipulation of swarming behaviour (i.e. \"lure and kill\" approach) are discussed. The importance of further research on the chemical cues routing mosquito swarming and mating dynamics is highlighted. Besides radiation, transgenic and symbiont-based mosquito control approaches, an effective option may be the employ of biological control agents of mosquito young instars, in the presence of ultra-low quantities of nanoformulated botanicals, which boost their predation rates."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"2","Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Parasitology research","ISOAbbreviation":"Parasitol.

All rights reserved.","AbstractText":["The Zika virus outbreak has captivated the attention of the global audience and information has spread rapidly and wildly through the internet and other media channels. This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes."]},"ELocationID":["S0896-8411(16)30008-7","10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.006"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"26","Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Journal of autoimmunity","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

This update contains a new recommendation for routine care for infants born to mothers who traveled to or resided in areas with Zika virus transmission during pregnancy but did not receive Zika virus testing, when the infant has a normal head circumference, normal prenatal and postnatal ultrasounds (if performed), and normal physical examination. Acute Zika virus disease should be suspected in an infant or child aged \u003c18 years who 1) traveled to or resided in an affected area within the past 2 weeks and 2) has â¥2 of the following manifestations: fever, rash, conjunctivitis, or arthralgia. Because maternal-infant transmission of Zika virus during delivery is possible, acute Zika virus disease should also be suspected in an infant during the first 2 weeks of life 1) whose mother traveled to or resided in an affected area within 2 weeks of delivery and 2) who has â¥2 of the following manifestations: fever, rash, conjunctivitis, or arthralgia. Evidence suggests that Zika virus illness in children is usually mild (2). As an arboviral disease, Zika virus disease is nationally notifiable. Health care providers should report suspected cases of Zika virus disease to their local, state, or territorial health departments to arrange testing and so that action can be taken to reduce the risk for local Zika virus transmission. As new information becomes available, these guidelines will be updated: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/."]},"ELocationID":["10.15585/mmwr.mm6507e1"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"65","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"MMWR.

To explore the therapeutic effect of integrated traditional Chinese and Western Medicine for Zika virus disease, the treatment process of the first imported case in China was reviewed.","The first imported Zika virus disease in China was admitted to Ganxian People's Hospital in Jiangxi Province on February 6th, 2016, and the patient received isolation treatment for 9 days and cured later. The effect of antiviral treatments including Xiyanping injection was evaluated based on clinical diagnosis and treatment process of the patient.","A 34-year old male patient was admitted with chief complaint of fever for 9 days, orbital pain and itching rash for 4 days on February 6th, 2016. (1) Epidemiological characteristics: the patient was bitted by mosquitoes during his business trip in Venezuela since January 1st, where Zika virus disease was spreading. On January 20th he had dizziness without fever, and the symptom disappeared after taking medicines without details. Paroxysmal dizziness, chills and mild fever without myalgia was experienced on January 28th. On February 3rd small red rash appeared in the neck, spreading to anterior part of chest, limbs and trunk, and the fever, fatigue, nausea was continued, and a new symptom of paroxysmal pain in back of ears and orbits appeared, during which he had not go to hospital. The symptoms relieved on February 4th. He returned to Ganxian County on February 5th, he had yellow stool 3 times with normal temperature, without abdominal pain, and red rash still appeared in the neck. He went to Ganxian People's Hospital on February 6th, 2016. (2) Clinical manifestation: the vital signs showed a temperature of 36.8?centigrade, a pulse rate of 80 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20 bpm, and a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). It was showed by physical examination that red rash appeared in the neck, and no superficial enlarged lymph nodes were found. Bilateral conjunctival congestion was obvious, physiological reflex existed and pathological reflex was not found. (3) Auxiliary lab test and examination: no abnormal finding were revealed throughout examination and laboratory tests, including routine blood test, liver function, renal function, serum myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, blood sugar, C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin I (TnI), and procalcitonin (PCT), except slight prolongation in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT, 38.6 s) on February 6th; and slightly dense shadow in left lung in lung CT scan, considering inflammatory changes and slight emphysema (especially in the left lower lung) as well as bilateral renal calculus on February 8th. No significant abnormalities were found in electrocardiogram and B ultrasound test of liver, spleen, and pancreas. (4) Virus confirmation: Zika virus nucleic acid was positive reported by Jiangxi Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on February 7th and Chinese CDC on February 9th, respectively, though Dengue virus were negative reported by Ganzhou CDC on February 6th. Right after the first diagnosis, anyone who had been in close contact with the patient received medical monitoring. (5)Treatment process: on February 6th, symptomatic treatment was prescribed since admitted into the infectious isolation wards and daily intravenous drip of Xiyanping injection 250 mg was prescribed for antiviral therapy. On February 7th, the patient had no fever, with occasional chills, neck rash was disappeared, orbital pain relieved and bilateral conjunctival hyperemia range was paler and narrowed, and his condition improved. Ibuprofen was administered for defervesce 3 times a day when his temperature reached to 37.5?centigrade at 16:00. On February 8th, the patient had no fever, times of chills was significantly reduced, without myalgia and rash, orbital pain and conjunctival hyperemia further recovered. On February 9th, bilateral eyes slightly tingling, mild conjunctival congestion, no fever chills or other discomfort was found. The chloramphenicol eye drops was prescribed for relieving sting pain with conjunctival congestion twice a day as recombinant human interferon alpha eye drops was out of store. The patient was comfortable from February 11th to February 13th. Blood and urine test for Zika were reported negative by the Chinese CDC and Jiangxi Province CDC. Because all the discharge criteria were satisfied, the patient was discharged on February 14th.","At present, there is no specific effective drug to prevent and treat Zika virus disease effectually. After receiving symptomatic treatment and antiviral treatments including Xiyanping injection, the patient's symptoms were relieved. Zika virus nucleic acid in blood and urine was negative. The patient was discharged. Combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine maybe a good method to prevent and treat Zika virus disease."]},"ELocationID":["10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-4352.2016.02.005"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"28","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue","ISOAbbreviation":"Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue","ISSN":"2095-4352"},"ArticleTitle":"[Experience of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in first case of imported Zika virus disease in China].","Language":["chi"],"PublicationTypeList":["English Abstract","Journal Article"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"106-9"},"ArticleDate":[],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Department of Infectious Disease, Ganxian People's Hospital, Ganxian 341100, Jiangxi, China.

Given there are also no commercially available vaccines for these four arboviral infections, prevention is the key. To prevent mosquito or tick bites that might result in one of these arboviral diseases, people should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants while outside if feasible, apply insect repellant when going outdoors, using window screens or air conditioning to keep mosquitoes outside, and perform tick checks after being in wooded or brushy outdoor areas."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"22","Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Journal of neurovirology","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

All rights reserved.","AbstractText":["The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher than in previous years. Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly.","In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of ParaÃ­ba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil.","We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97-100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses.","These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.","Consellho Nacional de Desenvolvimento e Pesquisa (CNPq), FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)."]},"ELocationID":["S1473-3099(16)00095-5","10.1016/S1473-3099(16)00095-5"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"17","Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"The Lancet.

On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the occurrence of microcephaly cases in association with Zika virus infection to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.* On December 31, 2015, Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) reported the first locally acquired (index) case of Zika virus disease in a jurisdiction of the United States in a patient from southeastern Puerto Rico. During November 23, 2015-January 28, 2016, passive and enhanced surveillance for Zika virus disease identified 30 laboratory-confirmed cases. Most (93%) patients resided in eastern Puerto Rico or the San Juan metropolitan area. The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were rash (77%), myalgia (77%), arthralgia (73%), and fever (73%). Three (10%) patients were hospitalized. One case occurred in a patient hospitalized for Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and one occurred in a pregnant woman. Because the most common mosquito vector of Zika virus, Aedes aegypti, is present throughout Puerto Rico, Zika virus is expected to continue to spread across the island. The public health response in Puerto Rico is being coordinated by PRDH with assistance from CDC. Clinicians in Puerto Rico should report all cases of microcephaly, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and suspected Zika virus disease to PRDH. Other adverse reproductive outcomes, including fetal demise associated with Zika virus infection, should be reported to PRDH. To avoid infection with Zika virus, residents of and visitors to Puerto Rico, particularly pregnant women, should strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites, including wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts, using permethrin-treated clothing and gear, using an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent, and ensuring that windows and doors have intact screens."]},"ELocationID":["10.15585/mmwr.mm6506e2"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"65","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"MMWR.

However, a surge in the number of children born with microcephaly was noted in regions of Brazil with a high prevalence of suspected Zika virus disease cases. More than 4,700 suspected cases of microcephaly were reported from mid-2015 through January 2016, although additional investigations might eventually result in a revised lower number (2).

In May 2015, the World Health Organization confirmed the first local transmission of Zika virus in the Americas in Brazil. The virus has spread rapidly to other countries in the Americas; as of January 29, 2016, local transmission has been detected in at least 22 countries or territories, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Zika virus can infect pregnant women in all three trimesters. Although pregnant women do not appear to be more susceptible to or more severely affected by Zika virus infection, maternal-fetal transmission has been documented. Several pieces of evidence suggest that maternal Zika virus infection is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, most notably microcephaly. Because of the number of countries and territories with local Zika virus transmission, it is likely that obstetric health care providers will care for pregnant women who live in or have traveled to an area of local Zika virus transmission. We review information on Zika virus, its clinical presentation, modes of transmission, laboratory testing, effects during pregnancy, and methods of prevention to assist obstetric health care providers in caring for pregnant women considering travel or with a history of travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission and pregnant women residing in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"17","Year":"2016","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Obstetrics and gynecology","ISOAbbreviation":"Obstet Gynecol","ISSN":"1873-233X"},"ArticleTitle":"Zika Virus and Pregnancy: What Obstetric Health Care Providers Need to Know.","Language":["ENG"],"PublicationTypeList":["JOURNAL ARTICLE"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":""},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"17","Year":"2016","Month":"2"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Meaney-Delman","Initials":"D","ForeName":"Dana"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Rasmussen","Initials":"SA","ForeName":"Sonja A"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Staples","Initials":"JE","ForeName":"J Erin"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Oduyebo","Initials":"T","ForeName":"Titilope"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Ellington","Initials":"SR","ForeName":"Sascha R"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Petersen","Initials":"EE","ForeName":"Emily E"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Fischer","Initials":"M","ForeName":"Marc"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Jamieson","Initials":"DJ","ForeName":"Denise J"}]},"KeywordList":[],"SpaceFlightMission":[],"DateRevised":{"Day":"20","Year":"2016","Month":"2"},"CitationSubset":[],"OtherID":[],"DateCreated":{"Day":"18","Year":"2016","Month":"2"},"GeneralNote":[],"PMID":"26889662"},"PubmedData":{"History":[{"Day":"19","Year":"2016","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"19","Year":"2016","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"19","Year":"2016","Month":"2","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"}],"PublicationStatus":"aheadofprint","ArticleIdList":["10.1097/AOG.0000000000001378","26889662"]}}

Testing can be offered 2-12 weeks after pregnant women return from travel. This update also expands guidance to women who reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, and includes recommendations for screening, testing, and management of pregnant women and recommendations for counseling women of reproductive age (15-44 years). Pregnant women who reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission have an ongoing risk for infection throughout their pregnancy. For pregnant women with clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease,* testing is recommended during the first week of illness. For asymptomatic pregnant women residing in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, testing is recommended at the initiation of prenatal care with follow-up testing mid-second trimester. Local health officials should determine when to implement testing of asymptomatic pregnant women based on information about levels of Zika virus transmission and laboratory capacity.

It is considered an emerging arbovirus transmitted by mosquitos of the genus Aedes. Its first description took place in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda, isolated on Rhesus monkey used as bait to study the yellow fever virus. Sporadic cases have been detected in African countries and at the end of the 70's in Indonesia. In 2007, epidemics were described in Micronesia and other islands in the Pacific Ocean and more recently in Brazil. Clinical picture is characterized as a 'dengue-like' syndrome, with abrupt onset of fever and an early onset evanescent rash, often pruritic. Occasionally the disease has been associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Nevertheless, until now deaths and complications caused by the disease were not reported. The diagnosis can be performed by PCR or by IgG and IgM antibodies detection. The rapid spread of the virus and its epidemic potential are especially problematic in countries where there are the circulation of other arboviruses whichimposes difficulties in the differential diagnosis and healthcare burden. Control measures are the same recommended for dengue and chikungunya which are based in health education and vector control."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"28","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2015 Nov-Dec"}},"Title":"Acta meÌdica portuguesa","ISOAbbreviation":"Acta Med Port","ISSN":"1646-0758"},"ArticleTitle":"[Zika Virus: A Review to Clinicians].","Language":["por"],"PublicationTypeList":["English Abstract","Journal Article","Review"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"760-5"},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"31","Year":"2015","Month":"12"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Departamento de Epidemiologia e Vigil'ncia em SaÃºde.

In America, it is transmitted mainly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, but Aedes albopictus is the main vector in other regions of the world. This work estimates the risk of disease emergence and the corresponding population at risk for the case of a naive population in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, the capital city of Argentina.","A classic metapopulation epidemiological model, that considers human and mosquito populations, was extended in order to include different environmental signals. First, the vital rates of the mosquitoes were affected by local temperature. Second, habitat availability estimated from satellite images was used to determine the carrying capacity for local mosquito populations. Disease invasion was proposed to occur at different moments of the year. For each scenario, Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the risk of disease invasion and the population at risk.","The risk of a Chikungunya outbreak displays strong temporal (seasonal) patterns as well as spatial variability at the level of neighborhoods in the study area. According to the model, Summer and Fall display high risk for a Chikungunya invasion. The population at risk displays less variation over the year underlying the importance of preventive actions.","The ability of mapping habitat quality for vector-borne diseases allows developing risk analysis at scales that are easily manageable for public health officers. For this location, the correlation of disease risk with the season of the year and the habitat availability could provide information to develop efficient control strategies. This also underlines the importance of involving the whole community when developing control measures for Chikungunya fever and other recently invading vector-borne diseases such as Zika fever."]},"ELocationID":["10.1186/s12879-016-1348-y"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"16","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"BMC infectious diseases","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Infect.

Pediatric health care providers should work closely with obstetric providers to identify infants whose mothers were potentially infected with Zika virus during pregnancy (based on travel to or residence in an area with Zika virus transmission [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices]), and review fetal ultrasounds and maternal testing for Zika virus infection (see Interim Guidelines for Pregnant Women During a Zika Virus Outbreak*) (1). Zika virus testing is recommended for 1) infants with microcephaly or intracranial calcifications born to women who traveled to or resided in an area with Zika virus transmission while pregnant; or 2) infants born to mothers with positive or inconclusive test results for Zika virus infection. For infants with laboratory evidence of a possible congenital Zika virus infection, additional clinical evaluation and follow-up is recommended.

By September, reports of an increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly in Zika virus-affected areas began to emerge, and Zika virus RNA was identified in the amniotic fluid of two women whose fetuses had been found to have microcephaly by prenatal ultrasound. The Brazil Ministry of Health (MoH) established a task force to investigate the possible association of microcephaly with Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a registry for incident microcephaly cases (head circumference â¥2 standard deviations [SD] below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth) and pregnancy outcomes among women suspected to have had Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Among a cohort of 35 infants with microcephaly born during August-October 2015 in eight of Brazil's 26 states and reported to the registry, the mothers of all 35 had lived in or visited Zika virus-affected areas during pregnancy, 25 (71%) infants had severe microcephaly (head circumference \u003e3 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age), 17 (49%) had at least one neurologic abnormality, and among 27 infants who had neuroimaging studies, all had abnormalities. Tests for other congenital infections were negative. All infants had a lumbar puncture as part of the evaluation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were sent to a reference laboratory in Brazil for Zika virus testing; results are not yet available. Further studies are needed to confirm the association of microcephaly with Zika virus infection during pregnancy and to understand any other adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with Zika virus infection. Pregnant women in Zika virus-affected areas should protect themselves from mosquito bites by using air conditioning, screens, or nets when indoors, wearing long sleeves and pants, using permethrin-treated clothing and gear, and using insect repellents when outdoors. Pregnant and lactating women can use all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents according to the product label."]},"ELocationID":["10.15585/mmwr.mm6503e2"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"65","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"MMWR.

The spreading and establishment of the mosquito Aedes aegypti in these islands might be linked to human migration. Ae. aegypti is the major vector of arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses) in the region. The intense circulation of these viruses in the Pacific during the last decade led to an increase of vector control measures by local health authorities. The aim of this study is to analyze the genetic relationships among Ae. aegypti populations in this region.","We studied the genetic variability and population genetics of 270 Ae. aegypti, sampled from 9 locations in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga and French Polynesia by analyzing nine microsatellites and two mitochondrial DNA regions (CO1 and ND4). Microsatellite markers revealed heterogeneity in the genetic structure between the western, central and eastern Pacific island countries. The microsatellite markers indicate a statistically moderate differentiation (FST = 0.136; P \u003c = 0.001) in relation to island isolation. A high degree of mixed ancestry can be observed in the most important towns (e.g. Noumea, Suva and Papeete) compared with the most isolated islands (e.g. Ouvea and Vaitahu).

Pregnant women with a history of travel to an area with Zika virus transmission and who report two or more symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease (acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis) during or within 2 weeks of travel, or who have ultrasound findings of fetal microcephaly or intracranial calcifications, should be tested for Zika virus infection in consultation with their state or local health department. Testing is not indicated for women without a travel history to an area with Zika virus transmission. In pregnant women with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, serial ultrasound examination should be considered to monitor fetal growth and anatomy and referral to a maternal-fetal medicine or infectious disease specialist with expertise in pregnancy management is recommended.

Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","AbstractText":["Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are bloodsucking vectors of human and animal pathogens. Mosquito-borne diseases (malaria, filariasis, dengue, zika, and chikungunya) cause severe mortality and morbidity annually, and tsetse fly-borne diseases (African trypanosomes causing sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock) cost Sub-Saharan Africa an estimated US$ 4750 million annually. Current reliance on insecticides for vector control is unsustainable: due to increasing insecticide resistance and growing concerns about health and environmental impacts of chemical control there is a growing need for novel, effective and safe biologically-based methods that are more sustainable. The integration of the sterile insect technique has proven successful to manage crop pests and disease vectors, particularly tsetse flies, and is likely to prove effective against mosquito vectors, particularly once sex-separation methods are improved. Transgenic and symbiont-based approaches are in development, and more advanced in (particularly Aedes) mosquitoes than in tsetse flies; however, issues around stability, sustainability and biosecurity have to be addressed, especially when considering population replacement approaches. Regulatory issues and those relating to intellectual property and economic cost of application must also be overcome. Standardised methods to assess insect quality are required to compare and predict efficacy of the different approaches. Different combinations of these three approaches could be integrated to maximise their benefits, and all have the potential to be used in tsetse and mosquito area-wide integrated pest management programmes."]},"ELocationID":["10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.01.009","S0001-706X(16)30009-2"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"157","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"May"}},"Title":"Acta tropica","ISOAbbreviation":"Acta Trop.","ISSN":"1873-6254"},"ArticleTitle":"More than one rabbit out of the hat: Radiation, transgenic and symbiont-based approaches for sustainable management of mosquito and tsetse fly populations.","Language":["eng"],"PublicationTypeList":["Journal Article","Review"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"115-30"},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"13","Year":"2016","Month":"01"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Insect Pest Control Sub-programme, Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, Vienna, Austria.

The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), is an invasive species, which is spreading throughout the world, and is a potential vector of 24 arboviruses, particularly efficient in the transmission of chikungunya, dengue, and zika viruses. Using a 4âÃâ4 Latin square design, we assessed the efficacy of the new BG-Sentinel 2 mosquito trap using the attractants BG-lure and (R)-1-octen-3-ol cartridge, alone or in combination, and with and without carbon dioxide, for the field collection of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.We found a synergistic effect of attractant and carbon dioxide that significantly increased twofold to fivefold the capture rate of Ae. albopictus. In combination with carbon dioxide, BG-lure cartridge is more effective than (R)-1-octen-3-ol in attracting females, while a combination of both attractants and carbon dioxide is the most effective for capturing males. In the absence of carbon dioxide, BG-lure cartridge alone did not increase the capture of males or females when compared with an unbaited trap. However, the synergistic effect of carbon dioxide and BG-lure makes this the most efficient combination in attracting Ae. albopictus."]},"ELocationID":["tjv184"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"PubDate":{"Day":"18","Year":"2015","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Journal of medical entomology","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

Multiple arbovirus epidemics continue to occur and challenge blood safety policy makers in nonendemic developed countries. There is new documentation of transfusion transmission of dengue and Ross River viruses, and new or increased concern about chikungunya and Zika viruses. Pathogen inactivation has been shown to inactivate almost all bacterial species and several epidemic arboviruses that pose a transfusion transmission risk. The two available platelet pathogen inactivation technologies show different levels of pathogen inactivation as measured by in-vitro infectivity assays; the clinical significance of this finding is not known.","Pathogen inactivation can mitigate infectious risk and should do so more completely than other interventions such as donor questioning, donor/component recall, or donor testing. However, pathogen inactivation increases the cost of the pathogen-reduced blood component, which is a significant obstacle in the current healthcare environment. This may inhibit the ability to move forward with an effective new paradigm for blood safety that fulfills the implicit public trust in the blood system."]},"ELocationID":["10.1097/MOH.0000000000000186"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"22","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Current opinion in hematology","ISOAbbreviation":"Curr.

The innate immunity has a central role in the new classification of auto inflammatory diseases, neutrophilic dermatoses, neutrophilic urticaria or pseudo-neutrophilic urticaria. Comorbidities have been studied e.g. cardiovascular co morbidities for psoriasis, IBD associated with hidradenitis suppurativa or neurological disorders associated with pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid could be renamed as cutaneous pemphigoid, it can be induced by drugs especially gliptins. Genetic predispositions are analyzed in auto inflammatory diseases, psoriasis (HLA), drug eruptions (HLA or cytokines). Telaprevir often induces rashes, which can be severe but other treatments against hepatitis C as interferon can also induce debilitating rashes, some eligible for drug tolerance induction. European guidelines for the definition, classification, diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria have been published. Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions may be associated with severe systemic symptoms such as organ involvement in AGEP or the occurrence of a shock in DRESS. Allover Europe, there is now an epidemic of contact allergies to methylisothiazolinone (MIT), contained in cosmetics, wet wipes but also in paints. MIT should be tested at 2.000 ppm in water, included in the standard series for patch tests. Its role has to be evoked in any case localized on the face or hand, airborne or generalized eczema.

The ecological drivers of the pattern and frequency of virus infection in these species are largely unknown. We used time series analysis and Bayesian hierarchical count modeling on a long-term arbovirus dataset to test associations between mosquito abundance, weather variables, and the frequency of isolation of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. We found little correlation between mosquito abundance and viral isolations. Rainfall was a negative predictor of dengue virus (DENV) isolation but a positive predictor of Zika virus isolation. Temperature was a positive predictor of yellow fever virus (YFV) isolations but a negative predictor of DENV isolations. We found slight interference between viruses, with DENV negatively associated with concurrent YFV isolation and YFV negatively associated with concurrent isolation of chikungunya virus. These findings begin to characterize some of the ecological associations of sylvatic arboviruses with each other and climate and mosquito abundance."]},"ELocationID":["10.4269/ajtmh.13-0617"],"GrantList":[{"GrantID":"1U54GM088491-0109","Country":"United States","Acronym":"GM","Agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS"},{"GrantID":"AI069145","Country":"United States","Acronym":"AI","Agency":"NIAID NIH HHS"},{"GrantID":"U54 GM088491","Country":"United States","Acronym":"GM","Agency":"NIGMS NIH HHS"}],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"92","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","ISOAbbreviation":"Am.

Amplification of a conserved region of the non-structural protein 5 gene of the genus Flavivirus yielded a polymerase chain reaction product with a matching sequence of 99% identity with Zika virus. A urine sample and a nasopharygeal swab specimen obtained for the measles investigation were also positive for this virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

One of these species, the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, is an important vector of emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika fevers. Integrated mosquito management (IMM) of Ae. albopictus is particularly difficult because it requires access to private yards in urban and suburban residences. It has become apparent that in the event of a public health concern due to this species, homeowners will have to be active participants in the control process by reducing mosquito habitats in their properties, an activity known as source reduction. However, limited attempts at quantifying the effect of source reduction by homeowners have had mixed results. Of note, many mosquito control programs in the US have some form of education outreach, however the primary approach is often passive focusing on the distribution of education materials as flyers. In 2010, we evaluated the use of active community peer education in a source reduction program, using AmeriCorps volunteers. The volunteers were mobilized over a 4-week period, in two areas with approximately 1,000 residences each in urban Mercer and suburban Monmouth counties in New Jersey, USA. The volunteers were first provided training on peridomestic mosquitoes and on basic approaches to reducing the number of container habitats for mosquito larvae in backyards. Within the two treatment areas the volunteers successfully engaged 758 separate homes. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant reduction in container habitats in the sites where the volunteers actively engaged the community compared to untreated control areas in both counties. Our results suggest that active education using community peer educators can be an effective means of source reduction, and a critical tool in the arsenal against peridomestic mosquitoes."]},"ELocationID":["10.1371/journal.pone.0108504"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"9","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2014"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203"},"ArticleTitle":"Integrating the public in mosquito management: active education by community peers can lead to significant reduction in peridomestic container mosquito habitats.","Language":["eng"],"PublicationTypeList":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e108504"},"ArticleDate":[{"Day":"25","Year":"2014","Month":"09"}],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Center for Vector Biology, Department of Entomology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Healy","Initials":"K","ForeName":"Kristen"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Center for Vector Biology, Department of Entomology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Hamilton","Initials":"G","ForeName":"George"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination Commission, Eatontown, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Crepeau","Initials":"T","ForeName":"Taryn"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination Commission, Eatontown, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Healy","Initials":"S","ForeName":"Sean"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Mercer County Mosquito Commission, West Trenton, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Unlu","Initials":"I","ForeName":"Isik"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Mercer County Mosquito Commission, West Trenton, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Farajollahi","Initials":"A","ForeName":"Ary"},{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"Center for Vector Biology, Department of Entomology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States of America."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Fonseca","Initials":"DM","ForeName":"Dina M"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":[{"Day":"","Year":"2014","Month":""},{"Day":"3","Year":"2014","Month":"6"},{"Day":"1","Year":"2014","Month":"9"},{"Day":"25","Year":"2014","Month":"9"},{"Day":"26","Year":"2014","Month":"9","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"26","Year":"2014","Month":"9","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"15","Year":"2015","Month":"12","Minute":"0","Hour":"6"}],"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":["10.1371/journal.pone.0108504","PONE-D-14-24788","25255027","PMC4177891"]}}

Longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles of 16 Californian rabbits (CW) and 16 Germany great line of ZIKA rabbits (GZ) were collected at the ages of 35d and 84d (slaughter age). The results showed that the live weights of GZ rabbits of 35d and 84d old were approximately 36% and 26% greater than those of CW rabbits, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that at the age of 84d GZ rabbits contained significantly lower MSTN mRNA level and higher MyoG mRNA level in both longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles than CW rabbits, and mRNA levels of MSTN and MyoG exhibited opposite changes from the age of 35d to 84d, suggesting that GZ rabbits were subjected to less growth inhibition from MSTN at slaughter age, which occurred most possibly in skeletal muscles. Four types of fiber were identified by real-time PCR in rabbit muscles, with MyHC-1 and MyHC-2D, MyHC-2B were the major types in biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles, respectively. At the age of 84d, GZ rabbits contained greater proportion of MyHC-1 and decreased proportion of MyHC-2D and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity in biceps femoris than CW rabbits, and the results were exactly opposite in longissimus dorsi, suggesting that GZ rabbits show higher oxidative capacity in biceps femoris muscle than CW rabbits. In conclusion, the trends of mRNA levels of MSTN and fiber types in GZ rabbits' skeletal muscles might be consistent with the putative fast growth characteristic of GZ rabbits compared to CW rabbits."]},"ELocationID":["10.1080/10495398.2013.865639"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"25","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2014"}},"Title":"Animal biotechnology","ISOAbbreviation":"Anim.

This was the case for the Japanese encephalitis virus which reached the northeastern part of Australia (1995) and, above all, for the West Nile virus which, since 1999, entirely colonized the American continent. Then, the Usutu virus invaded a large part of the Western Europe (2001) while the Zika virus caused a large epidemic in an island of Micronesia (2007). Finally, in 2010, the Tembusu virus devastated many duck farms in China while the Bagaza virus, after having provoked human encephalitis in India, reached the southern part of Spain. In the affected areas, new pathogenic outcomes were observed in humans and animals while new vertebrate hosts and mosquito species were infected. Moreover, unusual ways of contamination were described.

She was initially treated with antibiotics for a possible respiratory tract infection but with only minor effect. A chest x-ray and computer tomography (CT) of the thorax demonstrated a solid tumour in the right lung hilus. Bronchoscopy revealed slight oedema of the bronchial mucous membrane in the area in question. Cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) showed normal respiratory epithelial cells. Histological examination of a needle biopsy from the tumour showed lymphoproliferative changes of uncertain cause. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax provided no further information. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and sinus bradycardia. Her complaints were palpitations, mild exertional dyspnoea and attenuated heart rate response to exercise. Echocardiography showed increased wall thickness with heterogeneous echogenicity in both ventricles, a slightly enlarged left atrium and mild mitral regurgitation. Tissue Doppler measurements showed impaired relaxation. These findings were suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac MRI confirmed the echocardiographic findings. The tumour was removed by thoracotomy and was shown to be made up of lymphatic tissue with granulomas, consistent with sarcoidosis. The restrictive cardiomyopathy was regarded as a cardiac manifestation of sarcoidosis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. Clinical follow up with cardiac MRI and echocardiography did not reveal any progression of the cardiac involvement. Cardiac sarcoidosis must be considered in all sarcoid patients because of its significance for prognosis and treatment."]},"ELocationID":["10.4045/tidsskr.11.0615"],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"132","Issue":"12-13","PubDate":{"Day":"26","Year":"2012","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Tidsskrift for den Norske lÃ¦geforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny rÃ¦kke","ISOAbbreviation":"Tidsskr.

Several recent examples (Usutu virus and lineage-2 West Nile virus in central Europe, Zika virus in Micronesia) have shown that sources providing information on such scientifically largely neglected viruses are valuable tools for scientists and public health officials having to deal with such disease emergences. Furthermore the effects of global warming will lead to introduction of competent mosquito vectors into temperate climate zones and will increase efficiency of viral replication in less competent vector species.

No previous outbreaks and only 14 cases of Zika virus disease have been previously documented.","We obtained serum samples from patients and interviewed patients for information on clinical signs and symptoms. Zika virus disease was confirmed by a finding of Zika virus RNA or a specific neutralizing antibody response to Zika virus in the serum. Patients with IgM antibody against Zika virus who had a potentially cross-reactive neutralizing-antibody response were classified as having probable Zika virus disease. We conducted a household survey to estimate the proportion of Yap residents with IgM antibody against Zika virus and to identify possible mosquito vectors of Zika virus.","We identified 49 confirmed and 59 probable cases of Zika virus disease. The patients resided in 9 of the 10 municipalities on Yap. Rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis were common symptoms. No hospitalizations, hemorrhagic manifestations, or deaths due to Zika virus were reported. We estimated that 73% (95% confidence interval, 68 to 77) of Yap residents 3 years of age or older had been recently infected with Zika virus.

In this context the role of agriculture, where still 50% of the Chinese population are working, will be newly defined, and sustainability concepts can help to find a readjusted position within the Chinese economy focusing on environmental health and food safety as main targets of political and other supporting measures. Within the SUCCESS project, a Concept of Sustainable Agriculture was developed and it drafts one conceivable relation between the exposure to natural resources and economy and tries to find new answers to the broad range of rural challenges in China. It is a qualitative model and, therefore, not always fully applicable, but in the concrete situation of villages, it shows possible directions of sustainability-oriented development by considering the typical local potentials. In the Chinese context that means identifying the different functions of agriculture-the well-known and the hidden-to make them explicit for the Chinese public and therewith to give them new significance. The article is based on a 3-years study within the EU-China Project SUCCESS with field research in four Chinese rural communities. It analyzes the agricultural sustainability potential of these selected villages against the background of massive structural changes within the next 20 years in rural China.

The sequences of the three viruses were then scanned across the entire length of the ORF against available sequences of other African flaviviruses and selected reference viruses for genetic relatedness. The data collectively indicated that Kedougou virus was close to dengue viruses but nonetheless distinct, while Bagaza virus shared genetic relatedness with West Nile virus in several genomic regions.

Health information on many species, especially great apes, is extremely limited. Between 1996 and 1998, 84 free-ranging orangutans captured for translocation, underwent a complete health evaluation. Analogous data were gathered from 60 semi-captive orangutans in Malaysia. Baseline hematology and serology; vitamin, mineral and pesticide levels; and results of health evaluations, including physical examination, provide a baseline for future monitoring. Free-ranging and semi-captive orangutans shared exposure to 11 of 47 viruses. The semi-captive orangutans had significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to adenovirus (P \u003c 0.0005) and rota (SA 11) virus (P \u003c 0.008). More free-ranging than semi-captive animals had antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus (P \u003c 0.08) and foamy virus (P = 0.05). Exposure to parainfluenza and langat viruses was detected exclusively in semi-captive animals and exposure to sinbis virus was only found in free-ranging orangutans. There was evidence of exposure to respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie virus, dengue virus, and zika virus in both groups. Ebstein-Barr virus was ubiquitous in both groups. Prevalence of antibodies against mumps virus changed from 0% in 1996 to 45% in 1998. No antibodies were detected to many important zoonotic viral pathogens, including herpesvirus and hepatitis virus. Prevalence of Balantidium coli and Plasmodium pitheci infections and exposure to mycobacterium was higher in the semi-captive animals. Differences in exposure to pathogens between the groups may be due to environmental factors including differences in exposures to other species, habitat quality, nutritional status, and other potential stressors. Differences in health parameters between captive and free-ranging orangutans need to be considered when planning conservation areas, translocation procedures, and rehabilitation protocols. Because survival of the orangutan is linked to animal and ecosystem health, results of this study will assist wildlife conservation programs by providing baseline health information."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"39","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Journal of wildlife diseases","ISOAbbreviation":"J.

In order to evaluate the extent of amaril virus circulation and the risk for local people, a virological, entomological and epidemiological investigation was carried out by the ministry of health, the OCCGE, the CÃ´te d'Ivoire Pasteur Institute (IPCI) and the World Health Organisation in the area where the fatal case had been staying. 18 suspected and 24 confirmed mosquito catchers were identified by interview and a blood specimen was collected from each of them. In addition, 159 batches of mosquitoes from which 94 batches of potential vectors were collected; among the suspected cases, 22% were immunised against yellow fever. Serological and virological analyses were made at IPCI and the Paris Pasteur Institute by ELISA technique and isolation on cells cultures and newborn mice. All the suspicious sera and 87.5% of the catchers were positive for IgG anti-amaril virus. One catcher's serum was positive for IgM anti-amaril virus. 11 suspected sera were positive for IgG anti-dengue virus with 1 positive for IgM. 1 strain of amaril virus and 3 strains of Zika virus were isolated from mosquitoes at IPCI and confirmed by CRORA in Dakar.

To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo.

The animals were fed ad libitum with commercial feed mixture (till the average age of 64.days supplemented with Robenidin as coccidiostat). During the first 10 days of observation pooled samples of droppings from each cage were examinated by flotation-centrifugation method according to Breza (1957) and PavlÃ¡sek (1991) in the intervals of three to four days, later one-week intervals. Post mortem scrapings from mucous epithelium taken from young rabbits were examinated (to reveal endogenous developmental stages of C. parvum) together with digesta (to detect oocysts of the protozoon) taken from the full length of the small intestine using method of native preparations and Giemsa stain. In one 37-day dead animal the small and large intestines were examined histologically. The maximum number of young rabbits infected with C. parvum were 30-40 and 33-43 days old (Fig. 1). In animals of this age category the oocysts of the protozoon were found in pooled samples in 11 and 12 cages (39.3 and 42.9%) from totally 28 cages under study. In rabbits of more than 50 days of age the occurrence of infection was significantly decreased (3.7%). During the experiment seven rabbits (9.7%) died; six of them (8.3%) at the age of 30-40 days. All these naturally infected and dead animals represented cases of monoinfection with C. parvum. The major clinical signs were typical diarrhoea lasting 3-5 days, inappetency, apathia, lethargy, prominent signs of exhaustion followed by dehydration of the organism. Atrophy of villi of the ileum in one of young rabbits was found histologically. Table II presents concrete data on significantly lower body weights (the decrease being 7-61.5%) as compared with rabbits of the same age not infected with cryptosporidia. It was not possible to evaluate objectively the differences in susceptibility to C. parvum infection between the individual genotypes of rabbits. As was found in the course of our further studies (unpublished data) a possible source of infection of young rabbits can be represented by their mothers in which oocysts are excreted sporadically shortly before parturition and during several days after it. Cryptosporidium infection (cryptosporidiosis) in flocks of broiler rabbits is taken as a new protozoal disease in the Czech Republic and C. parvum as one of possible agents in cases of disorders of digestive tract, namely in rabbits after weaning."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"41","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"1996","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"VeterinaÌrniÌ mediciÌna","ISOAbbreviation":"Vet Med (Praha)","ISSN":"0375-8427"},"ArticleTitle":"[Spontaneous Cryptosporidium infection in weaned rabbits].","Language":["cze"],"PublicationTypeList":["English Abstract","Journal Article"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"361-6"},"ArticleDate":[],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[{"Identifier":[],"Affiliation":"National Veterinary Institute, Praha, Czech Republic."}],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"PavlÃ¡sek","Initials":"I","ForeName":"I"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"LÃ¡vicka","Initials":"M","ForeName":"M"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"TÅ¯movÃ¡","Initials":"E","ForeName":"E"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Skrivan","Initials":"M","ForeName":"M"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":[{"Day":"1","Year":"1996","Month":"12"},{"Day":"1","Year":"1996","Month":"12","Minute":"1","Hour":"0"},{"Day":"1","Year":"1996","Month":"12","Minute":"0","Hour":"0"}],"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":["9045499"]}}

The aim was to find an optimal group size for fattening rabbits with respect to animal welfare. The results show, that fattening performance and health of the rabbits have not been influenced remarkably by group size, whereas behaviour was different in so far, as the rabbits in groups of 16 showed a greater percentage of relaxed positions as well as a remarkable smaller percentage of aggressive behaviour.

The estimated number of cases was 12,000. The clinical features were consistent with a non-haemorrhagic dengue-like illness. Serum samples from 91 patients were analysed serologically for flavivirus infection (dengue 1-4, West Nile, yellow fever, Zika, Banzi, and Uganda-S), and virus isolation was attempted. Twelve strains of dengue 2 virus were isolated. Dengue infection was confirmed by a 4-fold or greater rise in immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody in paired serum specimens, the presence of IgM antibody, or isolation of the virus. Overall, 46 of the suspected cases (51%) were confirmed virologically or had serological evidence of a recent flavivirus infection. Statistical analysis showed that the presence of a rash was the best predictor of flavivirus seropositivity. In November 1992, Aedes aegypti was widespread and abundant in several districts of Djibouti city. A serological study of serum samples collected from Djiboutian military personnel 5 months before the epidemic showed that only 15/177 (8.5%) had flavivirus antibodies. These findings, together with a negative serosurvey for dengue serotypes 1-4 and yellow fever virus performed in 1987, support the conclusion that dengue 2 virus has only recently been introduced to Djibouti."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"90","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"1996 May-Jun"}},"Title":"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","ISOAbbreviation":"Trans.

Over a period of seven months these pairs were observed (2 h) and examined morphologically once a month. A video recording during 24 h was conducted. These observations showed that the frequency of aggressive and sexual behaviours was not very high and was not the same with all pairs. The frequency of aggressive, sexual and subdominant behaviour varied during the investigation, sometimes even within a month. There were a lot of amicable behaviour patterns (allogrooming, friendly nose-to-nose, nose-to-body contacts) and the females spent a lot of time in body-contact. Except with one pair there were hardly found any injuries despite the observed aggressive encounters. The dominance hierarchy in the different pairs was clear from the beginning and remained so during the experiment. The dominant females showed aggressive and sexual behaviour more frequently, all subdominant animals went away more frequently. The results suggest that keeping females in pairs before breeding starts or keeping them in pairs as laboratory rabbits is basically possible though the relation has to be checked all the time. Sufficient possibilities for occupation and a good structure of room are important. Because the degree of sexual influence of the females is not clear yet, further clarifications are needed."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"107","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"1994","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Berliner und MuÌnchener tieraÌrztliche Wochenschrift","ISOAbbreviation":"Berl.

In January 1979, seroepidemiological investigations were conducted during a YF epidemic in The Gambia, West Africa. Since a mass vaccination campaign was also in progress, it was important to confirm that the CF test could be used for serodiagnosis and determination of the incidence of natural YF infections. The serological responses of 58 individuals who received 17D YF vaccine were studied. The vaccinees fell into three gorups: 1) those with prevaccination YF neutralizing (N) antibodies; 2) immunological virgins without prevaccination YF-N antibody or hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies to heterologous flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, dengue 1, Uganda S, Spondweni, or Ntaya; and 3) those without prevaccination YF-N antibodies but with heterologous flaviviral HI antibodies. Vaccination of persons without prior flaviviral immunological experience resulted in monotypic YF HI and/or N antibody seroconversions, but no CF antibody response. The presence of prevaccination YF N antibodies blocked serological response to the vaccine in a high proportion of the cases; however, 24% of vaccinees in this group had a marked rise in log2 YF CF antibody titer (mean increase of 3.9). Thirteen (46%) of 28 persons without prevaccination YF N, but with heterologous flaviviral HI antibodies demonstrated YF CF antibody seroconversion or increase in titer following vaccination; in this group the mean increase in log2/ YF CF antibody titer was 2.1. The CF antibody response was generally broadly cross-reactive; but in a few individuals, the YF CF antibody response was homotypic. Nine different patterns of HI and CF homologous and heterologous antibody responses were defined and are discussed. The practical significance of these studies is that they demonstrate that in a high percentage of persons with prior flavivirus exposure, anamnestic serological responses to YF vaccine result in CF antibodies similar to those induced by natural YF virus infection. In Africa and tropical America, where the background of flaviviral immunity is high, it is imperative that seroepidemiologic investigations during or after YF outbreaks be conducted prior to vaccination."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"29","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"1980","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","ISOAbbreviation":"Am.

Serological studies carried out on monkey sera from different parts of Uganda, including the Entebbe area, during 1968 gave results which reflected a surprisingly low rate of YF immune monkeys (3%) throughout the country compared with the rate of over 40% immune monkeys obtained by Haddow et al. in 1951. 40% of the monkey sera collected during 1972 were immune to YF by the PT. Since no YF virus had been isolated between 1968 and 1972 the results indicate strongly that the monkeys in the Entebbe area were involved in the epizootic of 1972.

One of the areas where much work has been carried out is a strip of typical tropical forest, the Zika Forest, 12 kilometres from the Institute. Routine surveillance work, particularly on the biting activity of the yellow fever vector mosquitoes, has been going on since 1946.

Three sentinel rhesus monkeys, nomimmune to YF, which were kept in the Zika Forest during the time of the epizootic died of YF disease.

Due to the shortness of the survey, entomological prospections were confined to a search for Ae. aegypti larvae in and around dwellings: no breeding places are found in houses and Breteau indices are usually low, especially in forest villages. On the other hand, in urban settlements in the mining areas, breeding places around houses are numerous and are bound to increase in number. All the conditions necessary for the outbreak of an epidemic would be present within few years: such a situation would appear in Labour Camp where yellow fever virus has been circulating, where most of the population has no immunity and where Breteau indice goes as high as 34.4. As regards the other arboviruses, Zika virus is active in most areas and Chikungunya virus is particularly active in the plateau and savanna zones, in the North-East."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"68","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"1975 May-Jun"}},"ISOAbbreviation":"Bull Soc Pathol Exot Filiales","Title":"Bulletin de la SocieÌteÌ de pathologie exotique et de ses filiales"},"ArticleTitle":"[Serological and entomological study on yellow fever in Sierra Leone].","Language":["fre"],"PublicationTypeList":["English Abstract","Journal Article"],"Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"249-58"},"ArticleDate":[],"AuthorList":[{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Robin","Initials":"Y","ForeName":"Y"},{"AffiliationInfo":[],"Identifier":[],"LastName":"Mouchet","Initials":"J","ForeName":"J"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":[{"Day":"1","Year":"1975","Month":"5"},{"Day":"1","Year":"1975","Month":"5","Minute":"1","Hour":"0"},{"Day":"1","Year":"1975","Month":"5","Minute":"0","Hour":"0"}],"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":["1243735"]}}

The viruses isolated in largest numbers were chikungunya and yellow fever, which caused epidemics in 1969, and dengue types 1 and 2 and Tataguine, which are endemic in Ibadan. Bwamba virus was isolated in 1964 and 1969, and Bunyamwera group viruses were encountered for the first time in 1969. Other viruses recovered less frequently were Zika, Igbo-Ora (an agent related to o'nyong-nyong), two viruses related to the Uganda mosquito virus Ug MP 359, Dugbe, Thogoto, Lebombo and Shuni.

Sera collected in a serological survey in Kenya were therefore tested for antibodies against 3 group-A arboviruses (chikungunya, o'nyong-nyong and Sindbis), 6 group-B arboviruses (Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, Banzi, Wesselsbron and dengue 1), and Bunyamwera virus. The sera were examined mainly by the haemagglutination-inhibition test but a small proportion were also subjected to virus neutralization tests.The results showed that the prevalence of arbovirus tnfection varies markedly from area to area in Kenya. All types of arbovirus infections were more frequent on the coast than on the dry plateau around Kitui and the Lake Victoria area, The only exceptions were o'nyong-nyong and chikungunya, which were found to be just as prevalent on the coast as in Nyanza, where an epidemic was reported in 1959-60.

For five strains it is known at what height the mosquitos were caught: one was from mosquitos taken at ground level, and the other four were from mosquitos taken in or above the upper canopy after sunset. No small mammal trapped in the forest either on the ground or in the trees showed serum antibody for Zika virus.These findings suggest that in Zika forest, A. (S.) africanus becomes infected from a virus reservoir that is probably not among the small animals tested and that infected mosquitos are liable to be spread widely beyond the forest by convection currents above the tree-tops in the first two or three hours after sunset."]},"ELocationID":[],"Journal":{"JournalIssue":{"Volume":"31","PubDate":{"Year":"1964"}},"Title":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","ISOAbbreviation":"Bull.

The direct target cells of ZIKV in the developing human fetus are not clear. Here we show that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell-cycle-related pathways. Our results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, we establish a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Reports indicate that Zika is able to evade the normal immunoprotective responses of the placenta. Microcephaly has genetic causes, some associated with maternal exposures including radiation, tobacco smoke, alcohol, and viruses. Two hypotheses regarding the role of the placenta are possible: one is that the placenta directly conveys the Zika virus to the early embryo or fetus. Alternatively, the placenta itself might be mounting a response to the exposure; this response might be contributing to or causing the brain defect. This distinction is crucial to the diagnosis of fetuses at risk and the design of therapeutic strategies to prevent Zika-induced teratogenesis."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
